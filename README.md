### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at Warsaw School of Economics (SGH), pursuing a degree in Models and Methods of Quantitative Economics. I have a strong focus on coding in Python and SQL, and I'm currently participating in the Data Engineering zoocamp. When I'm not immersed in programming, you can find me indulging in my hobbies, which include exploring history, playing video games, and learning new languages (currently Spanish). I'm passionate about continuous learning and always eager to broaden my skill set.

Feel free to connect and collaborate!
